# Machine Learning Practice
This respository contains Jupyter notebooks and other Python programming dealing with machine learning topics.

I wanted to summarize the machine learning techniques I have learned and with which I have worked.

It's mainly for understanding how these topics work, are interpreted and can be applied to projects.

### Topics

#### Graphs
The directed-graphs.ipynb notebook contains experiments customizing graphs with NetworkX.  The images created from drawing the graphs and saving them can be found in the `images` folder.  There are various options for the appearances and additions of nodes and edges with this package and through Matplotlib's Pyplot library.
