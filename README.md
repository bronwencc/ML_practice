# Machine Learning Practice
This respository contains Jupyter notebooks and other Python programming dealing with machine learning topics.

I wanted to summarize the machine learning techniques I have learned and with which I have worked.

It's mainly for understanding how these topics work, are interpreted and can be applied to projects.

### Topics

#### Graphs
The [directed-graphs.ipynb](https://github.com/bronwencc/ML_practice/blob/main/directed-graphs.ipynb) notebook contains experiments customizing graphs with NetworkX.  The images created from drawing the graphs are saved in the [images folder](https://github.com/bronwencc/ML_practice/tree/main/images).  There are various options for the appearances and additions of nodes and edges with this package and through Matplotlib's Pyplot library.
The [multi-graphs.ipynb](https://github.com/bronwencc/ML_practice/blob/main/multi-graphs.ipynb) notebook experiments with creating a pseudo-random graph and using the shortest_path method from NetworkX.

#### SQL
The [sql-tables.ipynb](https://github.com/bronwencc/ML_practice/blob/main/sql-tables.ipynb) notebook contains code that creates a new SQL database and two tables within, stored as [authors_publications.sqlite](https://github.com/bronwencc/ML_practice/blob/main/authors_publications.sqlite).
